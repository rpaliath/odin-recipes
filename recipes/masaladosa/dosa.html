        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately under cold water. Soak them in water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>Drain the soaked ingredients. Grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds to a smooth batter, adding water as needed. Then grind the rice to a slightly coarse batter.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>Mix both batters together in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well. Cover and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>For the potato filling, heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add curry leaves, chopped onions, green chilies, and grated ginger. Saut√© until onions are translucent.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>Add turmeric powder and salt. Mix well. Add the mashed potatoes and combine everything thoroughly. Cook for a few minutes, then remove from heat and set aside.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick griddle or tawa over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the griddle and spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin crepe.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>Drizzle a little oil around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crispy. Flip if desired, but it's optional.
            </br><br></li>
            <li>Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the dosa. Fold the dosa over the filling to form a semi-circle or roll it up.
            </br><br></li>
        </ol><br>
