        <li>Basmati Rice - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Mixed Vegetables (carrots, peas, beans, bell peppers) - 1 cup, chopped</li>
        <li>Onion - 1 medium, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Garlic - 2 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Ginger - 1 inch piece, grated</li>
        <li>Cumin Seeds - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Cloves - 2-3</li>
        <li>Bay Leaf - 1</li>
        <li>Cardamom Pods - 2-3</li>
        <li>Turmeric Powder - 1/2 tsp</li>
        <li>Garam Masala - 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Water - 2 cups</li>
        <li>Oil or Ghee - 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Fresh Coriander - for garnish</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, cloves, bay leaf, and cardamom pods. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped mixed vegetables and sauté for 3-4 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well to coat the vegetables with the spices.</li>
        <li>Add the drained rice to the pan and gently stir to combine with the vegetables and spices.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.</li>        
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the pulao sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Serving</h2>
    <p>Garnish the vegetable pulao with fresh coriander and serve hot with raita or a side salad.</p>
